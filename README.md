# HackShare

HackShare is the ultimate knowledge sharing platform for fellows where they can help each other learn new skills.

## Getting Started

This guide will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. Have a look at **[deployment](#Deployment)** for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Requirements

Make sure that you have the following requirements already installed in your system.

- [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/)
- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/)

### Installation Guidelines

A step by step guide on getting a development environment up and running

```
git clone https://github.com/eKhattak/hackshare.git
```

This will grab a local copy of repository

- Open project directory in terminal

```
cd client
npm install

Compiled successfully!

You can now view client in the browser.

  Local:            http://localhost:3000
